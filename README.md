# rubikSolver
Program to virtually represent a rubik's cube and auto-solve it for you, providing the steps taken to do so.


Created using vim on an Ubuntu machine (at least initially). Any other OSs involved will be listed here for completion's sake.


Made as an exercise in multi-dimensional array manipulation.
